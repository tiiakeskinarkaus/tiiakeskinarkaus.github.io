"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"

If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

I read this interesting quote the other day:
>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"


>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street,
along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father
at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed
the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

1. Cut the cheese

   Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

   Be careful when holding the knife.
   
   For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.


We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!


## Exercise 2

1. **Keyhole Markup Language (KML)**
_Keyhole Markup Language (KML)_ was created in 2004 by Keyhole Inc and it was developed for to use with Keyhole Earth Viewer (Google Earth).  
It is an XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers and the KML file has features such as place marks, images and 3D models, etc. These features can be displayed on maps in geospatial software implementing the KML encoding.
KML has some of the same structural grammar as Geography Markup Language (GML)

2. **Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)**
_Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)_ is one of XML markup languages.  
It was developed in 2000 to make HTML more extensible and increase interoperability with other data formats. There are various
differences between XHTML and HTML, for example in syntax: XHTML is case-sensitive for element and attribute names, while HTML is not.
Besides syntactical differences, they behave differently on parse errors and JavaScript processing, and most content requiring namespaces don't work at all in HTML.

## Exercise 4
```C#
public class Person{
  private string name;
  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName)
  {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name = initialName;
  }
  public void PrintPerson()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
  }
  public void GrowOlder()
  {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}
